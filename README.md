# substratum
A new overlaying manager based off Sony's OverlayManagerService. This is the official repository of the substratum theme engine. The source is currently only accessible by team members.

# masquerade
Masquerade is Substratum's background service that runs functions that should run on a completely separate thread. This alleviates the stress on the main app and allows for Substratum to run more smoothly.
